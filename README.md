# Passcode Generator

## About

This is a little project for the coding bootcamp that I'm attending, intended to help us learn how to use Javascript. You will see a series of prompts that determine which characters you would like to include in your new passcode. Based on your responses, a passcode will be generated and displayed on the webpage.

## Languages Used

HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used in the making of this webpage, although the HTML and CSS were provided. Source code below!

## What I Learned

I have minimal experience with Javascript, so I learned a lot. I tried a few different techniques, such as going into the HTML and creating interactive elements for the options (radio buttons, number slider, etc), which didn't quite meet the criteria when I went back and looked at the challenge description. I also tried using charCodes but that quickly became too confusing. In the end, keeping it as simple as possible was the way I decided to go.

## Thanks

Have a nice day! Thanks for reading.
